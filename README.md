## An Exploration of Fauna, FQL, and Netlify Functions

Deployed to https://lizlam-faunadb-example.netlify.app/

AWS Lambda vs. Netlify Functions
I've created an AWS Lambda before and thought the user experience was pretty unfriendly.
This was about 2 years ago, so it may be different now.  Since I've heard good things about Netlify Functions, I thought I'd give the documentation a read and give it a try.

I used create-react-app to start the project.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `netlify dev`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:8888](http://localhost:8888) to view it in the browser.


## API
https://localhost:8888/.netlify/functions/orders    
https://localhost:8888/.netlify/functions/customers
https://localhost:8888/.netlify/functions/products

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.
